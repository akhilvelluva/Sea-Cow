#Mapping of sea cow individual reads to Dugong genome
Here we used the  fastq2bam for reading and  merging the fastq reads into BAM format. 
-m option will attempt to merge or trim reads. 
Bwa bam2bam will take the indexed reference genome file and map with the parameter set of -n (num-diff) -o (max-gap-open) -l (seed-length) -p (listen-port) -t (num-threads).
#CMD
fastq2bam -m -1 Read_R1.fastq  -2 Read_R2.fastq |  bwa bam2bam -g Reference.fasta -n 0.01 -o 2 -l 16000 -p 4711 -t 48 -f Aligned.bam -
